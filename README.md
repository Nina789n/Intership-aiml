Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
The Car-Price-Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on various factors such as its make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant features. 
The project leverages data-driven techniques to create a predictive model that can estimate the resale price of cars, which is particularly useful for car dealerships, individuals looking to buy or sell used cars, and those interested in understanding market trends in the automotive industry.

This project involves multiple stages, including:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: A dataset containing details of various used cars is gathered. The data is then cleaned and preprocessed, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables,
and scaling numerical features to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the relationships between different car features and their prices. T
his helps in understanding which features are most influential in predicting the car prices.

Model Building & Training: Different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost are used to train a model on the data, learning the patterns and correlations between car features and prices.

Model Evaluation & Prediction: The trained model is evaluated on its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to ensure its accuracy and generalizability. Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be used to predict the price of other used cars based on their features.

The project is a valuable exercise for those learning how to apply machine learning to real-world problems, particularly in the field of predictive analytics and the automotive industry.
